This implements reading the sensors from the  SenseCAP Indicator D1S via the UART connection from the hard-wired RP2040 2nd MCU.

This doesn't work with the stock firmware on the RP2040, you've to flash https://github.com/HomeDicator/RP2040-Firmware to the RP2040 using https://platformio.org/.

```yaml
# example configuration:

sensor:
  - platform: json_uart
    name: "CO2 Level"
    key: "scd4x.co2"
    unit_of_measurement: "ppm"
    icon: "mdi:molecule-co2"
    accuracy_decimals: 0

    uart_id: uart_rp2040
  - platform: json_uart
    name: "Temperature"
    key: "scd4x.temp"
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    icon: "mdi:thermometer"

    uart_id: uart_rp2040
  - platform: json_uart
    name: "Humidity"
    key: "scd4x.humidity"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    icon: "mdi:water-percent"
    uart_id: uart_rp2040
```
